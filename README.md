This repository contains my reading notes as well as my progress on the
developed example applications while reading:

**David Chelimsky:** *The RSpec Book. Behaviour-Driven Develpment with RSpec,
Cucumber, and Friends*

The book is published by *The Pragmatic Programmers* and can be obtained by
their [Website](http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book).
